4. ##### üè´ Level-Specific Notes

| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Primary School**   | Class Teacher role dominant, Exams minimal, simpler course structures |
| **Secondary School** | HODs exist, exam management crucial (ZIMSEC), attendance/report cards |
| **College**          | Lecturers, Registrars, Deans, often modular-based learning            |
| **Polytechnic**      | Similar to colleges, includes technical/practical resource access     |
| **University**       | Full hierarchy applies (Registrar, Bursar, Deans, Departments)        |


5. ##### Secure IDs for DB Tables
| Entity             | Recommended ID Type      | Why                                                                  |
| ------------------ | ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **User**           | ‚úÖ `UUID`                 | You may integrate external auth, parents & students exposed via APIs |
| **Institution**    | ‚úÖ `UUID`                 | Safer for multitenant design (supporting many schools)               |
| **Role**           | ‚ùå `i32`                  | Roles are few, internal, and unlikely to be exposed                  |
| **Permission**     | ‚ùå `i32`                  | Static set, not worth UUID overhead                                  |
| **RolePermission** | ‚ùå `i32` or composite key | Pure join table, `i32` is faster                                     |
| **UserRole**       | ‚úÖ `UUID`                 | Ties user to context ‚Äî safer and scalable                            |
